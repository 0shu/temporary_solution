## Prologue
It doesn't feel real yet. The new year. It's here, and yet its not right?
I'd originally wanted to put out a post before the new year and started writing, but soon realised the idea for this blog was a LOT of words and nobody was gonna read that ramble.
Every good story starts somewhere in the middle and then does that cool flashback -> present shot reverse shot kinda thing.
And this blog just has to do the same. I'll slowly over the course of things go through my backstory. But for now I just gotta hit the ground running.

## TL;DR a.k.a the Intro
So to cut things short.
Hi, I'm Joshua Simons. A 24yo Game Dev living in the UK.
I'm making a blog. This blog. 
It's gonna have some stuff from life, some stuff from gamedev.
My point is to communicate honestly and keep track of things whilst sharing the nuggets of wisdom I aquire along the journey. 
Hopefully in its entirety it'll either be kinda amusing to read back on for me and those that know me.
Or maybe it'll be an actually useful tool, another lense into game development and something those I'm further ahead of can look to for some semblance of advice/warning/random cool tidbits.
Yaknow it's sort of a two for one deal on content. It helps me, and maybe it'll help you.

## How When What Where Why
- I'm gonna be writing this up in plaintext on my PC (with .md style formatting for enhanced style) and distibuting it via git.
- I'm going to try and write something every day. Doesn't mean I'll upload every day though.
- My aim is to talk about game development concepts and life events I've encountered in my day. And maybe on slow days talk about my past. In both cases I'll try to extrapolate something useful.
- I live and do my work from the UK, but work along side people from multiple time zones.
- I suffer from thinks-too-much-and-never-writes-it-down-itis and this is a way to force me to write it all down.

## The art of Studiocraft
Allow me a paragraph or so for wishful thinking.
It's easy to get muddled and caught up on the ground in the fine details of what you're doing, but I think all life is enhanced by lofty dreams. With an eye to the stars you should make a wish of something impossible and far off.
For me that impossible dream is to run my own game studio. 
Maybe there's a lot of hubris in loudly declaring it at such a young age. I *know* it's a **long** way off yet.
But I wanted to make my intention clear from the start. (Plus, when I do make it, I get to be smug about how I called it from the start :p)

## Finally, today's content!
Today I finally cracked out Death Stranding. I'd seen Dunkey's review all those years ago and held off playing. Plus at the time of release I didn't really have a good enough system to run it lol.
Playing now was nice. I liked it a lot so far. The art looks fucking glorious. AAA games are 'worth their salt' after all.
It eased me into the mechanics at a decent pace. Though I recon I was giving it an extra dose of goodwill in that I'm going into it to be a dude that walks places and expecting the game mechanics to be traversal based like a mario, rather than badassery based like a zelda. I'm not sure how much I believe in the "the world needs america!" narrative that's going on. But I do think starting the game post-covid definitely gives a unique and potentially unexpected perspective on the joy of simply walking places on your own, and the importance of reestablishing human connection after that loneliness.

I was unsure if I'd get a menu or an unskippable cutscene but I was pleasantly suprised that the game actually launched me into a menu where I could change settings! Hurray :D
I *always* have to turn sound down because of how my system is set up and games like Fortnite and Dota 2 which just immediately play a bombastic video and refuse to let you change settings are super frustrating.

**Protip #1** ability to change settings must have first order importance when starting a new game, 
users know the quirks of their own setups and eyes/ears better than you the developer ever will!

## A wrap up for today
So yeah that's it for today! 
Expect more blogs about game dev life.
Today I played a game and that's about it for relevant content. It is a sunday after all!
It's a long journey ahead of me, thanks for coming along for the ride~
