# Second lasts a Year
*Joshua Simons - Thursday 3rd November 2022*

## Prologue
Hello you! Been a while.<br>
I hope you're doing well.<br>

## In the Meantime
A lot's happened. Biggest change? "Our" became "my".<br>
I get the sense most of the people in the industry that know us both prefer my ex to me.<br>
It sucks really because I tried so fucking hard not to mix work and my relationship.<br>
Now I have no work/life balance. Because I have no life. And having no life means my work output is crappy. Fucking lol<br>
<br>
Frankly the whole ordeal makes me want to have nothing to do with community management ever again.<br>
But I owe BBG my earnest effort. It's not about money at this point, it's duty.<br>
So when my brain still works, I do my best.<br>
<br>
Talking of my brain working, turns out being alone for long periods of time,<br>
 and feeling like everyone fucking hates you is not very good for your mental health.<br>
And when you're down, the sharks and vultures, oh the love to circle.<br>
Idk. I'll cease the bitterness now. But just know, it's been rough.<br>
<br>
How's gamedev though? Still working at Blue Bottle! Got a raise even~<br>
Also have some new additions to the work team. More brains woooo!<br>
They're all my favourites, for different reasons hahaha<br>

## Get. Back. On. The. Horse
The thing about gamedev, and well, most of life, is that sometimes it sucks no matter what.<br>
Sometimes the darkness is so fucking heavy that opening your eyelids is a full workout.<br>
But the secret weapon humans have that basically nothing else has is resilience.<br>
We're willing to put up with shit and keep trying, because we can look long term and be determined.<br>
So when it throws you off, get back on the horse.<br>
No matter what, just try keep moving, keep trying to do things right.<br>
It might throw you off once or twice, it might throw you off a hundred times. But eventually the horse tires.<br>
And then, that's when you ride.<br>

## What about today?
Today I tried going to Lidl early to pick up some croissants, only to find they'd not made them yet, oops!<br>
Next I made a coffee to wake myself up and tried to start my day only to give myself the shits... Maybe I have IBS?<br>
I did get a merge request approved and merged so that's good at least! Woot~<br>
Had a super difficult time trying to get work done though. Tasks have been hard to concentrate on today.<br>
I did get jetbrains, unity, discord set up on my laptop though, and I got the drivers updated!<br>
My plan is I'll stop going quite so mad if I have an easy way to travel and still work from anywhere hahaha.<br>
Basically I'm trying to work my way out of this hole I'm in, systemically.<br> 
Setting up things around me so my only choice is the right one.<br>
Later in the day I sat in on a meeting with our publisher! Love those folks ^^<br>
Tried to tackle the stack items dragging bug, but it's really a weird problem that has like 6 sub-problems to it :)))<br>
So yeah, recounting everything I realise I've done a lot more than I feel like I have, so I shouldn't be too guilty.<br>
I'm always guilty though. Tormented by my own mind.<br>
<br>
During my evening I rewatched The Social Network movie. The soundtrack to that one is incredible!<br>
Something about that movie makes coding seem pretty cool, even though all the characters are psychos lmao<br>
My eating hasn't be great recently either, and I havent been going out enough. Not good!<br>
I really have a terrible lack of human contact, and general exercise.<br>
Honestly it's lowkey surprising I'm not a morbidly obese ball of loathing at this point.<br>

**Protip #2** eat something nice, and homemade. At least everyone once in a while.<br>
Cooking and eating uses all your senses, and takes you out of the computer, whilst leaving room to think~<br>
It's the perfect opposite to game development! Makes for a good break<br>

## Signing off!
Man, I really need to forgive myself a little bit more.<br>
Guilt doesn't motivate me, it paralyses me, and I'm often blind to things I've done.<br>
Sorry if this one's more personal and less useful. That happens sometimes.<br>
It takes humans to make interesting games. So often along the way there's a lot of human moments.<br>
